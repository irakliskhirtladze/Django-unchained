# Django unchained

## Description
My first Django project for TBC Academy includes very basic functionality such as Start page,
user registration and login, user's home page and logout.

- 'Django_unchained' is the project folder
- 'users' is the first and only app for now.
- For respective pages I have used HTML templates located in 'templates' folder.

More features to be added in near future.

## Requirements
- Python 3.12

To install other requirements run in terminal:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Final words
Suggestions and corrections are more than welcome
